The remade Compressed Grass made by Grey Wind updates the original 1.7.10 version of the mod to 1.16.5. I will gradually improve and add the content that the original author did not add before.

For some reason, I will never publish any content on mcbbs, nor will I log in and use mcbbs again. If you need to publish relevant content, please contact me.(Generally speaking, I would agree)

---

This project will be rewritten from 2023.5.5, the exact completion date is unknown, and it is expected to be 3 months.

## Cooperation

I have sent a request to NeversXD(author of 1.7.10) on CurseForge to co-produce new versions. I found the user with the same name on Github, but I couldn't check the warehouse, so I didn't send a message to him on Github.

If you would like to work with me on this project (or any other project). Please call :15221369620(China) or email to 1953438158@qq.com

## About Author

The author of this mod is a junior high school student, which also makes it slow to update the mod.

Besides, I am in the third grade of junior high school now, and the senior high school entrance examination is approaching, so I will update it more slowly, mainly during the Chinese holidays.

## Sponsor

I don't have the Paypal, so please use Alipay or Wechat.
